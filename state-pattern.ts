/*

The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
. This pattern is close to the concept of finite-state machines. The state pattern 
can be interpreted as a strategy pattern, which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface. 

________________________

State Pattern: State pattern is used when an object changes its behavior depending on the internal state. 
It is a clean way of an Object to partially change its type or behavior at run-time.

_______________________
State Pattern: It is great when a developer wants to avoid primitive if/else statements. 
Instead of, extracting logic to separate classes and let our context object delegate the behavior 
to the methods implemented in-state class. Besides, we can leverage transitions between the states, 
where one state can alter the state of the context.
